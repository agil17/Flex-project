# Flex-project

This project took a few day. A lot more creativity could have been taken with the design of the site as opposed to trying to replicate the desired outcome, however, the purpose of the project was to show an understanding of the use of flexboxes and using basic html and css. Lots more practice is needed none-the-less.
